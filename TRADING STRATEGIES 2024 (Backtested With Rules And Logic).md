### 2. Trading Rules

### Article Summary: Inverted Yield Curve Trading Strategy

#### 1. Definition of an Inverted Yield Curve:
- **Normal Yield Curve**: Longer maturity bonds offer higher yields than shorter maturity bonds due to increased risk over time.

- The inverted yield curve has occurred 44 times since 1976.
- These inversions tend to be short-lived and clustered in small time windows.

#### 3. Trading Products:
- Stocks.
- Bonds (as a reference for the yield curve).

#### 4. Strategy Details:
- **Strategy One**: 
  - Buys when the yield curve inverts.
  - Holds for 250 trading days.
- **Strategy Two**:
  - Based on mean reversion of the yield curve.
  - Uses the RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicator.
  - Triggers trades based on overbought/oversold conditions.

#### 5. Backtest Performance:
- **Strategy One**:
  - Average return of 7.3% over 250 days since 1976.
  - Similar to the typical annual return.
- **Strategy Two**:
  - 102 trades since 1976.
  - Average gain of 2.5% per trade.
  - Investment period: almost 3 months per trade.

#### 6. Conclusions:
- The inverted yield curve trading strategy is not particularly useful for consistent profitability.
- Results are similar to random periods, indicating limited effectiveness.

#### 7. Final Note:
- The article suggests that while the inverted yield curve can signal market conditions, it does not consistently lead to profitable trading strategies.

<summary>020. Money Flow Index Strategy | MFI Trading Indicator (Backtest)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qmYEqzA7HI&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

### 1. **Introduction**
- The article introduces the Money Flow Index (MFI) as a simple and effective trading strategy that does not require advanced mathematical knowledge.
- It highlights the importance of understanding how price and volume influence market behavior.

---

### 2. **What is MFI?**
- The MFI is a momentum indicator that measures the flow of money into and out of a security by combining price and volume data.
- It oscillates between 0 and 100, indicating overbought (above 80) and oversold (below 20) market conditions.

---

### 3. **Strategy Details**
- The MFI trading strategy is based on three simple rules:
  - Buy at the close if the two-day MFI is below 10.
  - Sell at the close when the price exceeds the previous day's high with a 10-day stop loss.
- The strategy was tested using historical data, specifically starting from $100,000 in 1993.

---

### 4. **Backtest Performance**
- The backtest results show that the strategy generated impressive returns:
  - Starting with $100,000 in 1993, the portfolio grew to over $2 million by the end of the period.
  - Annualized returns were 10.5%, outperforming the buy-and-hold strategy, which returned 7.4% annually.
  - The strategy was active only 35% of the time, indicating a relatively conservative approach.

---

### 5. **Comparison with Other Indicators**
- The article contrasts MFI with other indicators like RSI (Relative Strength Index), noting that while RSI focuses solely on price action, MFI incorporates volume data for better insights into money flow.
- It suggests that traders should test both indicators to determine which works best for their specific trading style and asset class.

---

### 6. **Tips and Common Questions**
- The article addresses common questions about the MFI:
  - How is MFI calculated? It uses the typical price (average of high, low, and close) and volume data.
  - Overbought and oversold thresholds: 80 for overbought and 20 for oversold conditions.
  - Longer lookback periods smooth out volatility, while shorter periods may result in more frequent signals.
  - Divergences and trend reversals can also be used but are less reliable.

---

### 7. **Limitations and Drawbacks**
- The MFI is not without limitations:
  - It generates false signals due to its sensitivity to volatile price movements.
  - Losses are inevitable in trading, and a good trader must account for them.

---

### 8. **Conclusion**
- The article concludes that the MFI is a powerful tool for traders looking to identify profitable opportunities based on money flow dynamics.
- It encourages viewers to explore additional resources, such as other RSI strategies discussed in related videos, for further trading insights.

<summary>021. Trade the High - Short Interest Indicator (Trading Strategy)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6WIwn58sd4&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

### Summary of the Article on Short Interest and Stock Performance

1. **Definition of Short Interest**:
   - Short interest refers to the number of outstanding shares that have been sold short by traders or investors expecting a price decline.
   - Example: If a company has 1 billion shares outstanding, and 50 million are sold short, the short interest is 5%.

2. **Short Interest Ratio**:
   - The ratio measures the average number of days it takes for short sellers to cover their positions.
   - Example: If short interest is 5 million shares and daily turnover is 1 million shares, the ratio is 5.

3. **Distribution of Short Interest**:
   - Most heavily shorted stocks have a short interest of about 20%.
   - The lowest deciles (by short interest) have less than 2%.

4. **Performance Analysis**:
   - High short interest is associated with weaker future returns.
   - Stocks in the highest short interest decile tend to underperform compared to those with lower short interest.

5. **Case Study: GameStop Short Squeeze**:
   - The article highlights the GameStop short squeeze as an outlier, where shares surged due to retail traders buying up heavily shorted stocks.
   - However, such events are rare and not indicative of typical market behavior.

6. **Conclusion on High vs. Low Short Interest**:
   - Companies with low short interest outperform those with high short interest in the long term.
   - High short interest is generally bad for stock performance, as it often signals weaker returns.

7. **Investment Implications**:
   - Investors should be cautious when considering heavily shorted stocks due to their tendency for underperformance.
   - The article advises against relying on anecdotal data or short squeezes when evaluating investment opportunities.

8. **Final Advice**:
   - The video encourages viewers to stay informed and make educated trading decisions based on comprehensive analysis rather than isolated events.

#### 2. **Definition and Indicators**
   - Overbought is identified using numerical tools like the Relative Strength Index (RSI).
   - RSI oscillates between oversold and overbought conditions, indicating market velocity.
   - A high RSI value suggests an overbought or euphoric market.

       - Alternatively, exit after holding for more days (e.g., two days) and sell.

#### 4. **Backtest Performance**
   - The strategy was backtested to evaluate its effectiveness.
   - Results showed that returns in the first five days post-entry were significantly lower than the long-term average (~0.05% per day).
   - As holding time increased, returns gradually aligned with the long-term averages.

#### 5. **Conclusions**
   - Overbought conditions typically result in lower short-term returns compared to the market's historical average.

<summary>050. Martingale Trading Strategy (Backtest &amp; Rules)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlvO82W6QlA&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

### Article Summary: Martingale Trading Strategy

#### **Main Points Organized by Sections**

---

#### **1. Introduction to the Martingale Strategy**
- The Martingale strategy is a gambling-based approach where the bet size is doubled after each loss.
- The idea is that eventually, a win will recoup all previous losses.

---

#### **2. Mechanism of the Strategy**
- Start with an initial bet size (e.g., $100).
- After each loss, double the bet size: $200, $400, etc.
- Theoretically effective if the probability of winning a trade is 50%.

---

#### **3. Risks in Financial Markets**
- In practice, the probability of winning trades is rarely 50%.
- A series of consecutive losses can wipe out an account.
- Even when a win occurs, it may not fully recoup all previous losses due to the need for a larger win.

---

#### **4. Backtest Performance Example**
- Tested on the S&P 500 using specific trading rules (RSI indicators).
- Strategy claims an annual return of 8.7% despite low investment frequency.
- Modified strategy with partial equity allocation resulted in reduced total gains.

---

#### **5. Trading Rules and Indicators**
- Uses RSI (Relative Strength Index) as a trading indicator.
- Example: 
  - Enter trade when RSI crosses below 30 (allocate 33% of equity).
  - Increase allocation to 66% when RSI crosses below 20.

---

#### **6. Drawbacks of the Martingale Strategy**
- Reduces capital utilization, leaving funds on the sidelines.
- A few significant losses can lead to larger account drawdowns.
- The strategy is not suitable for financial markets due to its high risk and reliance on ideal conditions.

---

#### **7. Conclusion**
- The Martingale strategy is highly risky and unsuitable for trading in financial markets.
- It is better suited for gambling scenarios where odds are more favorable.
- Traders should seek alternative approaches for consistent profitability.

<summary>053. 3 Bollinger Band Trading Strategies (+Backtest)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZErni3FA24w&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

### 1. Introduction to Bollinger Bands
- **Definition**: Bollinger Bands are a popular trading indicator consisting of three components:
  - Middle Band: A simple N-day moving average (e.g., 10 days).
  - Upper Band: The middle band plus X standard deviations.
  - Lower Band: The middle band minus X standard deviations.
  
- **Purpose**:
  - Identify trends.
  - Measure volatility.
  - Signal potential breakouts or mean reversion opportunities.

---

### 2. Key Concepts
- **Standard Deviation**: 
  - A statistical measure of price deviation from the average, indicating market volatility.
  
- **Volatility Interpretation**:
  - Wider bands indicate high volatility; narrower bands suggest low volatility.
  - Future trends may be inferred from band behavior.

---

### 3. Trading Strategies Using Bollinger Bands
1. **Mean Reversion Strategy**:
   - **Mechanism**: Buy when prices close below the lower band and sell when prices close above the upper band.
   - **Example**: 
     - Use a 5-day moving average with reduced bands to 1.5 standard deviations.
     - This strategy has shown annual returns comparable to buy-and-hold, despite lower investment duration.

2. **Breakout Strategy**:
   - **Mechanism**: Enter trades when prices break above the upper band (bullish signal) or below the lower band (bearish signal).
   - **Considerations**: High risk due to potential for false signals and large drawdowns.

3. **Trend Following**:
   - **Mechanism**: Use bands to identify trend direction and continuation.
   - **Example**: Stay in the trade as long as prices remain within the bands, exiting when a band is breached.

---

### 4. Backtest Performance
1. **Mean Reversion Strategy (5-day MA with 1.5σ)**:
   - **Performance**:
     - Annual return: ~9% (vs. ~10% for buy-and-hold).
     - Win rate: 76%.
     - Drawdowns: Lower than buy-and-hold.
   - **Investment Duration**: Only 25% of trading days.

2. **Other Strategies**:
   - Breakout and trend-following strategies showed larger drawdowns but were still viable depending on risk tolerance.

---

### 5. Advantages of Bollinger Bands
- **Ease of Use**: Simple to interpret.
- **Versatility**: Applicable across asset classes (stocks, commodities).
- **Volatility Insight**: Provides clear understanding of market volatility.

---

### 6. Disadvantages and Common Mistakes
- **Large Drawdowns**: Strategies based on upper/lower bands may experience significant losses.
- **Asset-Specific Behavior**: Trading rules may not work across all asset classes due to differing behaviors.
- **Overfitting Risks**: Blindly applying rules without backtesting can lead to poor performance.

---

### 7. Additional Considerations
- **Alternative Bollinger Band Types**:
  - Percentage Bollinger Bands (uses percentage volatility instead of standard deviations).
  - Bollinger Bandwidth (measures the difference between bands).
  - Double Bollinger Bands (combines multiple bands for stronger signals).

- **Combination with Other Indicators**: 
  - Can be used alongside other technical indicators, but backtesting is essential to validate effectiveness.

---

### 8. Conclusion
- **Summary**:
  - Bollinger Bands are a powerful tool for identifying trends, volatility, breakouts, and mean reversion opportunities.
  - Success depends on strategy design, asset selection, and thorough backtesting.
  
- **Recommendation**: Always backtest trading ideas to ensure robust performance before implementation.

<summary>063. 3 Profitable Trading Strategies (Backtest &amp; Rules)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1qjX0Zxpd0&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

### Summary of the Article: Three Profitable Trading Strategies

#### Themes:
- **Mean Reversion vs. Trend Following**: The article explores both mean reversion and trend following strategies, as well as a combination of the two.
- **Diversification in Trading**: Emphasizes the importance of using multiple strategies that trade different markets, time frames, and market directions to enhance returns and reduce drawdowns.

#### Trading Products:
- **SPY ETF (S&P 500)**: Used for backtesting the rubber band strategy and the combined strategy.
- **QQQ ETF (NASDAQ 100)**: Used for backtesting the combined strategy.

#### Indicators:
- **Moving Averages**: 
  - 50-day Simple Moving Average (used in the Golden Cross strategy).
  - 200-day Simple or Exponential Moving Average (used to determine market trends and as a filter in the combined strategy).
- **RSI**: Mentioned in passing for future videos but not detailed in this article.

#### Strategy Details:
1. **Rubber Band Strategy**:
   - Focuses on mean reversion.
   - Involves buying oversold assets and selling overbought assets.
   - Example: Buying SPY when it is oversold (e.g., RSI < 30) and selling when it becomes overbought (e.g., RSI > 70).

2. **Golden Cross Strategy**:
   - Focuses on trend following.
   - Involves buying when the price crosses above the 50-day moving average and selling when it crosses below.

3. **Combined Strategy**:
   - Combines mean reversion (rubber band strategy) with trend following (Golden Cross strategy).
   - Adds a filter using the 200-day moving average to avoid entering trades in downtrending markets.
   - Example: Only enter rubber band signals when the price is above its 200-day moving average.

#### Backtest Performance:
- **Rubber Band Strategy**:
  - SPY: 12.5% annualized returns with short holding periods and modest drawdowns.
  - QQQ: 13.6% annualized returns with similar performance characteristics.

- **Golden Cross Strategy**:
  - SPY: 9.8% annualized returns with longer holding periods and larger drawdowns.
  - QQQ: Not explicitly mentioned but assumed to have similar performance.

- **Combined Strategy**:
  - SPY: 12.5% annualized returns, combining the benefits of both strategies while reducing drawdowns.
  - QQQ: 13.6% annualized returns, with even better performance due to the nature of growth stocks in NASDAQ.

#### Conclusions:
- **No Perfect Strategy**: Emphasizes that no single strategy is optimal and suggests using a diversified approach.
- **Importance of Diversification**: Trading multiple strategies across different markets, time frames, and market directions can enhance returns without significantly increasing drawdowns.
- **Finite Life of Strategies**: Recognizes that trading strategies have a finite lifespan due to market adaptability and changing conditions.

#### FAQ:
1. **Best Approach to Making a Profitable Strategy**:
   - Focus on backtesting with clear trading rules, followed by incubation or demo testing for at least 12 months.
   
2. **Most Profitable Trading Strategy**:
   - There is no single best strategy; using multiple complementary strategies is more effective.

3. **How Long a Strategy Can Last**:
   - Strategies typically have a finite lifespan, so diversification across different markets and time frames is crucial.

#### Final Thoughts:
- The article highlights the importance of combining different trading approaches to create a robust and adaptable trading system.
- It serves as an introduction to building profitable trading strategies, encouraging readers to explore and test various methods.

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sG6Gsxf0I5o&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

### Main Points Organized by Sections:

#### 1. **Introduction to Hikanashi**
- Hikanashi is a charting technique originated from Japan, introduced to the West in the late 1980s.
- It is another version of Japanese candlesticks but focuses on highlighting trends and consolidation phases.
- The name "hikanashi" translates to "average bar" in Japanese.

#### 2. **Calculation and Characteristics**
- Hikanashi smooths candlesticks using average open, high, low, and close values.
- Open and close prices are calculated using mathematical formulas, not real prices.
- Each hikanashi candle starts at the midpoint of the previous candle's body, eliminating gaps.
- It is a lagging indicator and cannot be used to trade directly on the chart.

#### 3. **Comparison with Traditional Candlesticks**
- Traditional candlesticks display actual price action (open, high, low, close).
- Hikanashi aims to indicate trends by smoothing price movements.
- Both tools are useful but serve different purposes; hikanashi eliminates noise, while traditional candlesticks provide raw data.

#### 4. **Best Time Frame for Hikanashi**
- Long time frames (e.g., monthly) are most suitable for hikanashi.
- Shorter time frames like daily or intraday are less effective for this technique.

#### 5. **Hikanashi Trading Strategy**
- **Strategy Rules:**
  - Buy when the close of hikanashi crosses above its open.
  - Sell when the close crosses below its open.
- **Backtest Results:**
  - Tested on the S&P 500 Index from 1960 to present using monthly data.
  - Strategy is trend-following and works best on long time frames.
  - Annual return of 4.77% compared to Buy and Hold's 7%.
  - Max drawdown of 30% vs. Buy and Hold's 53%.

#### 6. **Conclusion**
- Hikanashi is a useful tool for eliminating noise in prices and identifying trends or consolidation phases.
- It is not a direct representation of real prices but can be used to create profitable trading strategies.
- Backtesting is recommended before committing real money.

#### 7. **Additional Notes**

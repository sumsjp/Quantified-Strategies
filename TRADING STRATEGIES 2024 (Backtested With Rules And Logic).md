<summary>002. 3 SIMPLE Trend Following Trading Strategies (Backtest)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kJ_fWP5fKU&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy discussed is centered around **Trend Following**, which aims to capture extended market trends without predicting specific price points. Here's a concise summary:

### Core Concept of Trend Following:
- Focuses on riding ongoing market trends, whether up or down.
- Avoids trying to predict market tops or bottoms.
- Utilizes simple rules based on moving averages and other indicators to generate buy/sell signals.

### Key Strategies Presented:
1. **Monthly Moving Average Strategy:**
   - Uses the 12-month Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the S&P 500.
   - Rules: 
     - Go long when the current month's close crosses above the SMA.
     - Sell and hold cash when it crosses below.
   - Performance:
     - Annual return ~6.6% vs. Buy & Hold’s 7%.
     - Drawdowns lower at 26%.
     - Risk-adjusted Return: 9.6%.

2. **Golden Cross Strategy:**
   - Uses the 50-day and 200-day Moving Averages.
   - Rules:
     - Buy when 50-day SMA crosses above 200-day SMA (bullish signal).
     - Sell when it crosses below (bearish signal).
   - Performance:
     - Annual return ~6.6%.
     - Invested ~69% of the time.
     - Risk-adjusted Return: 9.5%.

3. **Super Trend Indicator Strategy:**
   - Based on weekly bars, using a median price with bands.
   - Rules:
     - Buy when close crosses above the Super Trend line.
     - Sell when it crosses below.
   - Performance:
     - Annual return ~6%.
     - Invested ~62% of the time.
     - Risk-adjusted Return: 9.5%.

### Advantages of Trend Following:
- **Simplicity:** Easy to implement with clear rules.
- **Low Maintenance:** Requires minimal daily management.
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns:** Lower drawdowns compared to Buy & Hold, offering better risk-reward ratios.

### Disadvantages:
- **Whipsawing:** Frequent false signals can lead to losses during market corrections.
- **Low Win Rate:** Many trades may result in losses, relying on a few profitable ones for gains.
- **Requires Discipline:** Must avoid cutting winners short and stick to the rules despite losing streaks.

### Conclusion:
Trend Following strategies offer a viable alternative to Buy & Hold, particularly appealing to those who prefer systematic, non-predictive approaches. However, they demand patience and discipline due to their reliance on big gains offsetting numerous smaller losses.

<summary>003. Death Cross Trading Strategies (Backtested+Rules)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12al7KQInww&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The Death Cross trading strategy is a technical analysis tool used to identify potential bearish trends in the stock market. Here's a concise summary of the strategy based on the video:

1. **Definition and Mechanics**:
   - The Death Cross occurs when a shorter-term moving average (e.g., 50-day) crosses below a longer-term moving average (e.g., 200-day). This signals a potential downtrend.

2. **Lagging Indicator**:
   - It is a lagging indicator, meaning it confirms trends after they have started, rather than predicting future price movements.

3. **Backtesting Results**:
   - Historical backtests since 1960 show poor performance during Death Cross periods, with minimal growth despite spending only 30% of the time in the market. This highlights the risk of missing out on market gains.

4. **Limitations**:
   - Infrequent occurrence (only 32 instances since 1960) and potential for long-term underperformance due to keeping investors out of the market during upward trends.
   - Applicability varies across different markets, requiring individual backtesting.

5. **Implementation Considerations**:
   - Use as part of a diversified strategy with other indicators or risk management techniques.
   - Psychological discipline is crucial, as waiting for entry signals (like the Golden Cross) can be challenging during market rises.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - While the Death Cross can signal significant downturns, its reliance on historical data and lack of adaptability to external factors make it a useful but limited tool. It may be more effective when combined with other strategies rather than used in isolation.

<summary>004. Friday 13th Trading Strategy (Backtest)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22GwTbRFrzE&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy presented combines elements of superstition and technical analysis. Here's a concise summary:

**Strategy Overview:**
- **Objective:** To capitalize on market behavior around Friday the 13th and identify trends for potential long positions.

**Rule 1 (Friday the 13th):**
- If the date is a Friday the 13th, evaluate the S&P 500's performance the previous day.
- **Action:**
  - Go LONG if the prior day's closing price was higher than the opening price.
  - Stay out of the market if the prior day ended lower.

**Rule 2 (Trend Following):**
- If Rule 1 is not applicable, assess whether the S&P 500 has been in an uptrend over the last three consecutive weeks.
- **Action:**
  - Enter a LONG position on Fridays if an uptrend is confirmed.
  - Do nothing otherwise.

**Rationale:**
- Friday the 13th isn't inherently unlucky for the market, with historical data showing similar performance to other Fridays. The strategy leverages prior day's price action on these dates.
- Trend analysis aims to capture sustained upward movements over three weeks, providing a longer-term perspective.

This strategy blends superstition (testing Friday the 13th) with technical analysis (trend following) to inform trading decisions.

<summary>005. MULTIPLE Time Frame Trading Strategy (+Backtest)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fASgIgUPrw&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy described is a **Multiple Time Frame Trading Strategy** designed to capitalize on longer-term trends while entering trades during short-term pullbacks. Here's a concise summary:

### Key Components:
1. **Long-Term Trend Filter**: The close must be higher than the close 250 days ago.
   - This ensures that the asset is in an uptrend over the long term.

2. **Intermediate Trend Filter**: The close must be higher than the close 22 days ago.
   - This confirms that the asset is trending upward on a medium-term basis.

3. **Short-Term Pullback Entry**: The close today must be a three-day low of the close.
   - This means entering the trade when the price pulls back to a short-term support level.

4. **Exit Rule**: Sell at the close when the close is higher than yesterday's close.
   - This exit rule aims to lock in profits as soon as the price moves upward from the entry point.

### Example:
The strategy was applied to the **XLP ETF**, which tracks Consumer Staples, with the following results:

- **Number of Trades**: 316
- **Average Gain per Trade**: 0.28%
- **Win Rate**: 73%
- **Maximum Drawdown**: -10%
- **Profit Factor**: 2

### Strategy Evaluation:
The strategy shows reasonable performance, with a decent win rate and profit factor. However, the average gain per trade is relatively low, which might indicate that the strategy relies on frequent small wins rather than occasional large gains.

### Conclusion:
This strategy combines multiple time frames to align entries with longer-term trends while using short-term pullbacks for entries. It appears to work well for the XLP ETF but may require testing on other assets and market conditions. For more details, you can refer to the source or contact the creators.

<summary>007. No Way These Returns Are True!  | Trading A Few Days a Month</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iAHRyUuW5g&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy presented in the video is based on a seasonal pattern where stocks tend to rally towards the end of a month and in the first few days of a new month. Here's a summary of the strategy:

1. **Entry Point**: 
   - Buy the S&P 500 on the fifth last trading day of the current month.

2. **Exit Point**:
   - Sell on the third trading day of the new month.

3. **Investment Period**:
   - The strategy involves being invested for only seven trading days per month (approximately 33% of the time).

4. **Performance**:
   - The annual return is approximately 7%, which is slightly higher than a buy-and-hold strategy that yields about 6.9%.
   - Drawdowns are significantly smaller, at 27% compared to 56% for a buy-and-hold approach.

5. **Equity Curve**:
   - The equity grows linearly over time with fewer market fluctuations compared to being invested all the time.

6. **Improvements**:
   - The strategy has been optimized by reducing the investment period from 33% to 23% of trading days while still achieving an annual return of approximately 6.7%. These improved trading rules are available for subscribing members who pay a small fee.

7. **Additional Information**:
   - The video mentions that more strategies, including swing strategies, will be provided in future videos.
   - Subscribers can access these strategies monthly for a fee, while non-subscribers are encouraged to wait for free content in upcoming videos.

Overall, the strategy aims to capitalize on market trends during specific parts of the month while minimizing time invested and drawdowns.

<summary>008. 2 Inverted Yield Curve Strategies (Rules and backtest)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=573OfvS1foc&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The inverted yield curve trading strategy involves using an inverted yield curve as a signal to make trades. The strategy was backtested twice, with the first buying when the curve inverts and selling 250 days later, yielding an average return of around 7.3% annually, similar to typical annual returns. The second strategy uses mean reversion and the RSI indicator, resulting in an average gain of 2.5% over almost three months per trade. Overall, the research suggests that this strategy is not particularly useful for profitable trading.

<summary>009. Trading the SANTA CLAUS Christmas Rally (Seasonal Trading Strategy)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60CKmOTmb70&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy leverages the Santa Claus rally phenomenon observed in gold prices, hypothesizing that gold experiences a stronger seasonal uptick around the end of the year compared to stocks. Here's a structured summary of the strategy:

### Strategy Overview:
- **Buy Signal**: Enter into a long position on gold at the close of the December options expiration day.
- **Sell Signal**: Exit the position either at the market close on December 31st or on the first trading day of January.

### Key Points:
1. **Historical Performance**:
   - The strategy has yielded an average return of over 2% per trade since the year 2000.
   
2. **Options Expiration Day**:
   - Utilizes volatility and potential price movements associated with options traders adjusting positions, which can create buying pressure.

3. **MarketPsychology**:
   - Capitalizes on investor optimism at year-end, similar to the Santa Claus rally observed in stocks but applied to gold.
   
4. **Newsletter Mention**:
   - The strategy is part of a service offered through Quantified Strategies, with more details available via their newsletter.

### Considerations and Analysis:

- **Risk Management**: Potential volatility around options expiration; stop-loss mechanisms may be necessary.
- **Execution Concerns**: Note that December 31st market closures could impact trade execution.
- **External Factors**: Gold prices are influenced by economic indicators, geopolitical events, and interest rates, which might override seasonal trends.
- **Backtesting Methodology**: Importance of understanding how historical returns were calculated to ensure accuracy and absence of cherry-picking.
- **Diversification and Portfolio Fit**: Assessing how this strategy integrates with a broader investment approach.

### Conclusion:

While the strategy shows promising historical returns, further analysis is recommended to evaluate its robustness across diverse market conditions, including potential anomalies and external influences. Potential traders should consider subscribing to the newsletter for additional insights but remain cautious of any overoptimistic claims without thorough validation.

<summary>010. SECTOR ROTATION strategy  (Backtest and Rules)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GfsFt5Wxzw&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy described is a momentum-based sector rotation approach that involves rotating among four ETFs: SPY (S&P 500), TLT (long-term Treasuries), EFA (non-US developed markets), and EEM (emerging markets). Here's a structured summary of the strategy and considerations:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Sector Rotation**: The strategy involves switching investments between different asset classes or ETFs based on their recent performance.
2. **Monthly Ranking**: Each month, the ETFs are ranked based on their performance from the previous month.
3. **Selection and Holding**: The ETF with the best performance is selected to go long for a one-month holding period. This process is repeated monthly.

### Key Features:
- **Diversification**: The ETFs cover US equities, bonds, international developed markets, and emerging markets, providing exposure to different asset classes.
- **Performance**: Backtesting indicated an annual return of 10.1% with an average gain per trade of 1.3%, performing well until 2022.

### Considerations and Questions:
1. **Transaction Costs**: Frequent trading could incur significant fees, potentially reducing profitability. The impact of these costs on the strategy's returns is unclear.
2. **Tiebreakers**: The process for handling equal performance among ETFs (e.g., tiebreakers) isn't specified.
3. **Portfolio Construction**: The strategy doesn't mention holding cash; it always holds an ETF, which may lead to forced investments during poor-performing periods.
4. **Risk Management**: Lacks explicit risk management beyond switching ETFs, potentially exposing the portfolio to significant drawdowns if an ETF crashes during the holding period.
5. **Market Cycles and Drawdowns**: The strategy's performance across different market cycles (e.g., bear markets) is not detailed, and volatility in returns isn't addressed.
6. **Comparison with Other Strategies**: The strategy hasn't been compared to buy-and-hold or other methods like equal-weighting. Metrics like Sharpe ratio would provide deeper insights into risk-adjusted returns.
7. **Implementation Details**: The mention of an "email broker" is unclear, but it likely refers to a brokerage account suitable for frequent trading with low fees.
8. **Survivorship Bias**: Potential issues with backtesting results not accounting for underperforming strategies that aren't included.

### Conclusion:
The strategy leverages momentum across asset classes through monthly rotation, offering diversification benefits and historical performance. However, it raises questions about transaction costs, risk management, and sustainability across varying market conditions. Further analysis would be needed to evaluate its robustness and effectiveness in different environments.

<summary>011. 3 Momentum Trading Strategies (Backtests &amp; Rules)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NWcKpupjJo&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading video discusses three distinct momentum trading strategies, each tailored for different assets and market conditions. Here's a summary of the key points covered:

### 1. **First Momentum Strategy: 100-Day High/Low Close**
   - **Rules**: 
     - Go long when the closing price crosses above the highest close in the past 100 days.
     - Sell when the closing price crosses below the lowest close in the past 100 days.
   - **Backtest Results**:
     - Applied to the S&P 500 from 1960 to present.
     - Starting capital of $100,000 grows to $5.5 million over 60 years, yielding ~6.5% annualized returns (excluding dividends; ~8.5% with dividends).
   - **Performance**:
     - Engages in the market only 69% of the time.
     - Low drawdowns and risk-adjusted returns, outperforming a "Buy & Hold" strategy during major bear markets.

### 2. **Second Momentum Strategy: 25-Day High Close for Assets with Price Spikes**
   - **Rules**:
     - Buy when the closing price sets a new high over the past 25 days.
     - Sell when the closing price drops below this high.
   - **Backtest Results**:
     - Applied to Bitcoin, showing significant growth (though results are influenced by Bitcoin's overall rise).
     - Market participation is low (~13.9% of the time), yet performance remains competitive with "Buy & Hold."
   - **Performance**:
     - Low drawdowns and solid risk-adjusted returns, suitable for volatile assets like Bitcoin.

### 3. **Third Momentum Strategy: Sector Rotation System**
   - **Rules**:
     - Monthly rebalancing by ranking four ETFs (S&P 500 (SPY), Long-Term Treasuries (TLT), Developed Markets (EFA), and Emerging Markets (EEM)) based on their prior three-month performance.
     - Invest in the top-performing asset each month.
   - **Backtest Results**:
     - Starting capital of $100,000 grows to ~$1.4 million over 20 years (~13.1% annualized returns).
   - **Performance**:
     - Drawdowns are manageable (e.g., ~34%), with relatively low correlation to the stock market.
     - Slowed performance in recent years, likely due to market changes.

### Key Takeaways on Momentum Strategies
- **Momentum vs. Mean Reversion**: Emphasizes buying strength rather than weakness.
- **Optimal Settings**:
  - Time frames: 3 to 12 months for stocks; other assets may vary (e.g., daily or weekly).
  - Asset Classes: Effective across various classes, including stocks and commodities.
- **Success Factors**:
  - Backtesting is crucial.
  - Combine with indicators (e.g., using momentum with a monthly time frame but entering on daily pullbacks).
  - Use demo accounts for testing before live trading.

### Closing Note
The video concludes by encouraging viewers to explore their own strategies and suggests checking out the website for additional resources. The next video will focus on mean reversion strategies.

<summary>012. Limit Order Trading Strategy (Rules +Backtest )</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7b9dU8tDYtQ&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

In this trading strategy video, the focus is on comparing market orders and limit orders to demonstrate how different order types can lead to vastly different outcomes. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Understanding Limit Orders**: A limit order is used to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better. It includes a "limit price" which specifies the maximum price to pay for a purchase or the minimum price to accept for a sale.

2. **Backtesting Strategies**:
   - A mean reversion strategy was backtested using a market order on NASDAQ 100. The results showed an average gain of 89% per trade, translating to a compounded annual return of 10.4%. However, the strategy only had an 18% investment utilization rate, meaning the capital was idle for long periods.
   - When the same strategy was modified to use a limit order for the buy signal (buying on weakness), the number of trades significantly decreased by more than half. Despite this, the average gain per trade increased from 89% to 12%. However, the overall compounded annual return dropped to 7.6%, primarily due to missed trading opportunities.

3. **Trade-offs in Trading**: Using a limit order can improve the average gain per trade but may result in fewer trades and lower total returns. This highlights the importance of understanding the trade-offs between different order types and strategy parameters.

4. **Conclusion**: The video emphasizes that while adjusting strategies to use limit orders might enhance individual trade profitability, it can also reduce overall return potential. It encourages viewers to consider their objectives, risk tolerance, and trading goals when deciding on an order type or strategy.

The video concludes by inviting comments for further discussion on possible improvements or variations of the strategy.

<summary>013. Williams %R Strategy: (Rules Revealed + Backtest))</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hrpH-b_2es&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The Williams Percentage R trading strategy is a technical indicator used to identify overbought and oversold conditions in the market. Here's a summary of the strategy:

1. **Definition**: The indicator measures the current close relative to the highest high over a specified period, ranging from 0 to -100. A reading above -20 indicates an overbought condition, while below -80 suggests oversold.

2. **Strategy Rules**:
   - Enter a long position when the indicator crosses below -90.
   - Exit the trade when the indicator crosses above -30 or if the close exceeds yesterday's high.

3. **Backtesting Results**: 
   - The strategy has an annual return of 11.5% over 580 trades, outperforming a Buy and Hold approach (e.g., S&P 500) during periods like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - It operates with only 22% market exposure, reducing risk.

4. **Drawbacks**: The strategy has a moderate maximum drawdown of 177%, so it's essential to consider transaction costs and risks.

5. **Conclusion**: The Williams Percentage R is a simple yet effective tool, particularly during market turmoil, but should be tested with historical data and potentially using fractional shares to manage risk.

<summary>014. 3 ETF Trading Strategies (Backtest &amp; Rules)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EmDCJUgnrw&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The video discusses three ETF trading strategies, each with specific rules and performance metrics. Here's a summary of each strategy:

1. **Turnaround Tuesday Strategy**:
   - **Entry Rule**: Buy S&P 500 (SPY) at the close on a Monday if it's lower than Friday's close.
   - **Exit Rule**: Sell when the close is higher than yesterday's high or after five trading days.
   - **Performance**: A $100,000 investment grew to ~$2.2 million with an average gain per trade and only 24% investment time. Drawdowns were significantly lower (~23%) compared to buy-and-hold.

2. **Lower Lows and Lower Highs Strategy**:
   - **Entry Rule**: Buy when both the low and high of the day are lower for three consecutive days.
   - **Exit Rule**: Sell two days after buying on an up day with a higher close than yesterday's.
   - **Performance**: Provided ~8% annual returns, growing $100k to ~$600k. Experienced 31% drawdown during the 2000-2003 market but performed well afterward.

3. **Momentum Rotation Strategy (Meb Faber)**:
   - **Assets**: SPY (S&P 500), GLD (Gold), TLT (Bonds).
   - **Entry Rule**: Invest in assets where the 3-month moving average is above the 10-month MA, allocating thirds to each ETF.
   - **Performance**: ~8% annual returns with a modest Max Drawdown. Strategies are diversified across asset classes.

**Key Takeaways**:
- No single "best" strategy; diversify across different strategies, time frames (long-term vs short-term), and market directions (both long and short).
- ETFs offer reduced risk compared to individual stocks but unlikely to have massive winners.
- Beginners should start with demo accounts and test strategies for at least a year before live trading.
- Longer timeframes (daily/weekly/monthly bars) are generally better suited for retail traders.

<summary>015. Fabian Timing Model Strategy (Trading Rules &amp; Backtest) #shorts</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gH33k5W334&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The Fabian Timing Model is a quantitative trend-following strategy developed by Richard Fabian in the mid-1960s. It is based on the observation that the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the utility sector tend to move together. Here's a summary of the strategy:

### Trading Rules:
1. **Buy Signal**: 
   - The strategy signals a "buy" for the S&P 500 when all three indices (S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the utility sector) are above their respective 39-week moving averages.

2. **Sell Signal**:
   - It signals a "sell" when two or more of these indices are below their respective 39-week moving averages.

### Backtest Results (from 2000 using SPY ETF):
- The model outperformed a "buy and hold" strategy, generating a 7% return versus 5% for buy-and-hold.
- It was invested only 56% of the time, indicating significant time out of the market.
- The strategy is designed for long-term investing, not short-term gains.

### Key Notes:
- **Long-Term Focus**: The Fabian Timing Model is not intended for quick profits but rather for sustained growth over decades.
- **Patience and Time**: Consistency with the strategy requires patience and time to see positive results.
- **Further Reading**: For more details, consider reading the linked article or exploring additional resources on the website.

This strategy aims to capitalize on long-term trends by staying invested only when conditions are favorable, thereby potentially enhancing investment returns over time.

<summary>016. Value Investing vs Growth Investing Rotating Strategy</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UlOnc-3Uck&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy presented in the video focuses on rotating investments between value and growth stocks based on their relative performance. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Value vs. Growth Stocks**:
   - **Value Investing**: Involves buying undervalued stocks with strong fundamentals, expecting the market to recognize their true worth over time. These stocks are generally more stable and less volatile.
   - **Growth Investing**: Focuses on stocks expected to grow at a faster rate than the overall market. These stocks often have higher valuations due to their growth potential but can be more volatile.

2. **Historical Performance**:
   - Value stocks have historically outperformed growth stocks over the long term, though growth stocks can outperform in the short term, especially during periods of economic growth or rising interest rates (e.g., post-2008 financial crisis).

3. **Rotation Strategy**:
   - The strategy involves using ETFs that track value and growth stocks: IUSV (value) and IUSG (growth).
   - A momentum ratio is calculated by dividing the price of IUSG by IUSV.
   - 10-day and 40-day moving averages are used to determine short-term momentum trends.

4. **Implementation**:
   - When value stocks outperform growth stocks, investors sell growth ETFs (IUSG) and buy value ETFs (IUSV).
   - Conversely, when growth stocks outperform, investors sell value ETFs and buy growth ETFs.
   - This rotation aims to capitalize on the relative strength of each asset class.

5. **Performance**:
   - The strategy claims an annual return of 9%, outperforming both value-only (7.4%) and growth-only investments.
   - It also reduces price variation, thereby lowering risk compared to holding individual stocks.

6. **Criticism**:
   - Critics argue that market timing is difficult and advocate for a "Buy and Hold" approach with diversification instead.

This strategy leverages the relative performance of value and growth ETFs to dynamically adjust holdings, aiming to capture superior returns by rotating based on momentum signals.

<summary>017. Currency Trading Strategies - &quot;From Carry Trades to Curve Trades&quot;</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZuBES1XZ4k&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy summarized is called "Curvy Trades," introduced in the research paper titled *From Carry Trades to Curvy Trades*. This approach represents a shift from traditional carry trade strategies, which rely solely on short-term interest rate differentials, by incorporating additional information from yield curves, specifically the Nelson-Siegel factors. 

Key features of Curvy Trades include:

1. **Higher Risk-Adjusted Returns**: The strategy offers a better Sharpe Ratio compared to traditional carry trades, indicating more consistent and less volatile returns.

2. **Reduced Crash Risk**: Unlike traditional carry trades that often involve currencies like the Japanese Yen or Swiss Franc, Curvy Trades are less susceptible to sudden market reversals or crash risks.

3. **Different Market Dynamics**: The study suggests that curvy trade returns are not adequately explained by standard pricing factors such as exchange rate volatility, implying they may be driven by different market dynamics.

4. **Yield Curve Insights**: A high curvature factor in the yield curve signals a higher future path of short-term rates, which can put upward pressure on currencies, offering valuable insights for trading decisions.

In conclusion, Curvy Trades leverage yield curve information to potentially revolutionize currency trading strategies, providing investors with innovative approaches to achieve better risk-adjusted returns and navigate market complexities.

<summary>018. 3 MACD Trading Strategies 2024 (Backtested With Rules)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h46J1xanfk&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

### Summary of the Trading Strategy:

The video presents three MACD-based trading strategies, each with specific rules and backtesting results. Here's an organized summary of each strategy and key takeaways:

---

#### **1. First Strategy: MACD Histogram Mean Reversion**
- **Mechanism**: Buys when the MACD histogram drops four consecutive days from a level below zero four days ago.
- **Performance**:
  - Annual return: ~5% (doesn't beat S&P 500's buy-and-hold).
  - Win rate: 89% (very high).
  - Drawdown: 16% (low).
  - Time in market: 5% (allows trading other strategies).
- **Conclusion**: Decent strategy due to low drawdown and high win rate, but limited returns.

---

#### **2. Second Strategy: MACD Histogram with Bollinger Bands**
- **Mechanism**: Enter long when the histogram crosses below the lower Bollinger Band; sell when it crosses above the upper band.
- **Performance**:
  - Return: $1.15M from $100K investment (8.4% annual).
  - Win rate: Solid, though not detailed.
  - Drawdown: 44% (high).
  - Time in market: 64%.
- **Conclusion**: Mixed performance; high drawdown may cause traders to abandon the strategy despite decent returns.

---

#### **3. Third Strategy: Best Performing Strategy (Members Only)**
- **Mechanism**: Involves RSI and has only one buy and sell rule.
- **Performance**:
  - Return: $1.5M from $100K investment.
  - Drawdown: 15% (low).
  - Time in market: 21% (low).
  - Annual return: Nearly as good as buy-and-hold.
  - Risk-adjusted return: 43% (annual return / time invested).
- **Conclusion**: The best strategy with low drawdown, high returns, and manageable slippage.

---

### Key Takeaways:
1. **MACD vs. RSI**: While MACD isn't the best indicator, it can be effective in certain contexts when combined with mean reversion or used alongside RSI.
2. **Market Suitability**: MACD works well in stocks/stock ETFs due to their mean-reverting nature, especially for swing trading (daily or weekly bars).
3. **Optimal Settings**: Short lookback periods (a few days) and daily bars are ideal for MACD analysis.
4. **Strategy Selection**: The third strategy (with RSI) is the most effective, but traders should evaluate their risk tolerance and time in market.

---

### Final Note:
The content emphasizes that these strategies aren't investment advice and encourage viewers to test strategies thoroughly before implementation.

<summary>019. Multiple Days Up (MDU) And Multiple Days Down (MDD). - Larry Connors</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j20XPfOcgQ&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy described in Chapter Six of Larry Connor's "High Probability Trading" is called the Multiple Days Up and Multiple Days Down Strategy. Here's a summary:

**Objective**: To identify potential buying opportunities when an ETF has experienced significant downward momentum.

**Key Components**:
1. **Entry Signal**: The strategy suggests entering a long position (buying) when an ETF has dropped at least four out of the last five trading days. This is indicated by a specific indicator that swings from low to high, signaling many down days.
   
2. **Supportive Conditions for Entry**:
   - The ETF's price must be above its 200-day moving average (to ensure it's not in a long-term downtrend).
   - The closing price must be below the 5-day moving average (indicating recent weakness).

3. **Entry Timing**: Enter the trade at the close of the day when one of the supportive conditions is met.

4. **Exit Signal**: Exit the trade (sell) when the ETF closes above its 5-day moving average, signaling a potential reversal.

5. **Risk Management**: No stop loss is used in this strategy, which increases risk but aims to capture trends once they have reversed.

**Backtesting Results**:
- Backtests were conducted on 20 different stock market ETFs from 2000 onwards.
- Results varied significantly across individual ETFs.
- When tested as a portfolio with allocations of 20% per signal (holding a maximum of five ETFs at a time), the strategy produced low annual returns due to minimal time spent in the market.
- Testing was also done on SPY and QQQ with 50% equity allocation each, but results remained unimpressive, showing erratic performance.

**Conclusion**: The strategy's results are not particularly impressive, and the creator suggests exploring other strategies available on their website for better outcomes. As always, trading carries risks, and viewers are encouraged to do thorough research before implementing any strategy.

This summary provides a concise overview of the strategy, its mechanics, and the backtesting outcomes mentioned in the video.

<summary>020. Money Flow Index Strategy | MFI Trading Indicator (Backtest)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qmYEqzA7HI&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy discussed is based on the Money Flow Index (MFI) indicator, which combines price and volume data to measure buying and selling pressure. Here's a concise summary:

1. **What is MFI?**
   - The MFI oscillates between 0 and 100, indicating overbought (above 80) or oversold (below 20) conditions.
   - It helps predict potential price reversals by showing money flow into or out of a security.

2. **Strategy Rules:**
   - Use a short look-back period (tested with 2 days).
   - Buy when the MFI is below 10 and close at the end of the second day.
   - Sell when the closing price exceeds the previous day's high.
   - Time stop set to 10 trading days.

3. **Performance:**
   - Backtesting from 1993 showed a significant return, turning $100k into over $2M (a 20x increase).
   - Annualized return of ~10.5% vs. buy-and-hold at ~9.7%, with the strategy being invested only 35% of the time.

4. **Considerations:**
   - Combining MFI with other indicators can enhance effectiveness but requires careful backtesting to avoid curve fitting.
   - Limitations include sensitivity to volatility and potential false signals, which are part of trading risks.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The strategy is simple, effective, and suitable for novice traders. Backtesting is recommended to customize settings based on specific assets.

This strategy leverages the MFI's ability to identify overbought/oversold conditions, aiming to capitalize on short-term price movements while keeping the approach straightforward and easy to execute.

<summary>021. Trade the High - Short Interest Indicator (Trading Strategy)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6WIwn58sd4&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy discussed in the video revolves around analyzing short interest in stocks. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Definition of Short Interest**: 
   - Short interest is the percentage of a company's outstanding shares that have been sold short.
   - Example: If a company has 1 billion shares and 50 million are shorted, the short interest is 5%.

2. **Short Interest Ratio**:
   - This measures how many days it would take for short sellers to cover their positions, based on average daily trading volume.

3. **Performance Analysis**:
   - The video references a study showing that stocks with high short interest (top deciles) tend to underperform in the subsequent year.
   - Conversely, stocks with low short interest outperform the market average.

4. **Outliers and Anecdotal Data**:
   - While exceptions like GameStop exist (where short squeezes lead to massive price increases), these are rare.
   - The strategy advises against relying on such outlier cases for making investment decisions.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - High short interest is generally associated with weaker future returns, suggesting it's "bad" for stock performance.
   - Investors should focus on stocks with low short interest if they aim to find the next multi-bagger.

The video emphasizes avoiding anecdotal data and focusing on historical trends to make informed trading decisions.

<summary>022. Gold Overnight Trading Strategy – Make Money While Sleeping</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AofDVmSjQjY&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy discussed focuses on the gold and gold miners sector, specifically utilizing ETFs such as GDX (gold miners ETF) and GLD (gold price ETF). The key idea revolves around holding positions overnight, from market close to the next open, rather than intraday.

### Key Points:
1. **Overnight Edge**: 
   - The strategy highlights that holding positions overnight in GDX and GLD has historically shown a consistent upward trend, resulting in steady gains.
   - Conversely, buying at the open and selling at the close (intraday) has often resulted in losses.

2. **Historical Consistency**:
   - The equity curve for GDX shows a stable upward slope when held overnight, whereas intraday trading has been less successful.
   - Similarly, GLD's performance from close to next open has outperformed compared to intraday returns, which have been slightly negative on average.

3. **Strategy Enhancement**:
   - While the overnight edge alone may not be significant enough for standalone trading, adding one or two other variables can enhance the strategy.
   - The video mentions a specific "Gold Overnight Strategy" for GLD that incorporates additional variables, resulting in a rising slope and consistent performance over nearly two decades.

4. **Offerings**:
   - The content creator provides subscribers with access to courses and strategies like this one through their website.

### Conclusion:
The strategy emphasizes the importance of holding positions overnight in gold-related ETFs for profitable trading, suggesting that combining overnight holds with additional variables can create a robust and consistent approach. For those interested, more detailed information is available on the creator's website.

<summary>023. Testing A Random Entry Trading Strategy</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDw5HhC9Lc8&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The "Work Trading" strategy is an intriguing approach that relies on making 12 random trades per year, each held for four days. Here's a concise summary of the key points:

1. **Strategy Overview**: The strategy involves selecting 12 trades annually based entirely on chance, without using indicators or analysis. Each trade is held for four days.

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **Average Gain per Trade**: Approximately 0.37 (unit unspecified, likely pips or percentage).
   - **Profit Factor**: 1.7, indicating more profits than losses.
   - **Maximum Drawdown**: Around 12%, which is relatively manageable.

3. **Skepticism and Considerations**:
   - The reliance on randomness in trading is unconventional, as typically a systematic approach with analysis is preferred for sustainability.
   - Despite positive metrics, the strategy's long-term viability is questioned due to market efficiency and unpredictability.
   - Risk management practices, such as position sizing, are crucial to avoid significant losses.

4. **Conclusion**: While the strategy shows decent performance metrics, its reliance on randomness raises doubts about its sustainability. It may serve as an experimental approach rather than a reliable long-term method. Further details on trade selection and execution would be essential for a comprehensive assessment.

In essence, while the strategy has some appealing results, caution is advised due to its random nature, and it may be more suitable as a test of unconventional methods rather than a primary trading approach.

<summary>024. What Happens To Stocks When Bonds Go Down?</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw1pit-dC8Y&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy discussed focuses on the relationship between bonds and stocks, particularly examining what happens to stocks when bonds decline. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Key Insight**: The strategy is based on the inverse relationship between stocks and interest rates. When interest rates rise (bonds go down), it becomes less attractive to hold riskier assets like stocks.

2. **Strategy Overview**:
   - **Entry Signal**: Buy stocks (using SPY as a proxy) when bond prices (using TLT, an ETF for 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds) fall below their moving average.
   - **Exit Signal**: Sell stocks when bond prices rise above their moving average.

3. **Backtesting Results**:
   - The strategy was backtested using different moving averages (5 to 100 days).
   - For the 15-day moving average, the strategy showed weak performance compared to SPY's historical returns.
   - Annual return was less than 1%, with a maximum drawdown of 50%.

4. **Interesting Observation**: Reversing the buy/sell signals (buying when bonds rise and selling when bonds fall) yielded better results, which will be explored in a subsequent video.

This strategy aims to capitalize on the inverse relationship between stocks and bonds but showed limited success in backtesting, suggesting potential room for improvement or alternative approaches.

<summary>025. Sell The Rip Trading Strategy (Backtest)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHj846zWHLY&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy discussed is called "Sell The Rip," which is based on the concept that financial markets move in waves, rising and falling. This strategy focuses on selling assets when they reach an overvalued level, aiming to capture profits at market highs.

### Key Points of the Strategy:
1. **Traditional Mean Reversion Strategy**:
   - Uses the 3-day RSI (Relative Strength Index) as a signal.
   - Buys when the RSI drops below 30 and sells when it reaches 70.
   - Results in erratic performance with high drawdowns (reaching 35% twice), making it difficult for traders to stick with.

2. **Improved "Sell The Rip" Signal**:
   - Sells when the closing price exceeds yesterday's high, indicating potential overvaluation.
   - Improves performance significantly compared to the original strategy:
     - Reduces drawdowns (only twice exceeding 20%).
     - Maintains competitive annual returns while keeping the invested time low (~27% of the time).

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Generates consistent returns with lower risk.
   - Annual returns are comparable to a "Buy and Hold" strategy but with less time in the market.

4. **Market Suitability**:
   - Works best for stock markets, where mean reversion is more common.
   - Less effective for commodities and forex, which tend to trend rather than revert.

### Conclusion:
The improved "Sell The Rip" strategy offers a viable approach for traders seeking to capitalize on overvalued assets. However, it's important to backtest the strategy for each specific market to determine its effectiveness. While it doesn't work universally across all markets, it provides a solid framework for trading in environments with mean reversion characteristics.

<summary>026. CANDLESTICKS Patterns Trading Strategies - Which One Is Best?</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6kvcga6zPQ&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy discussed focuses on leveraging candlestick patterns to make informed trades. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Candlestick Analysis**: The video introduces candlesticks as a tool for visualizing price movements in financial markets, suggesting they can be effective for generating profits.

2. **Backtesting and Quantification**: Instead of relying on anecdotal evidence, the strategy involves quantifying all candlestick patterns through backtesting. This process ranks the patterns based on performance metrics like the profit factor.

3. **Performance Results**: Over the past 30 years, using the top 10 candlestick patterns with at least 50 trades each, the strategy achieved a 20x return, outperforming a buy-and-hold approach by one percentage point. It also required less time investment (28% of the period).

4. **Drawdowns and Risk Management**: The strategy's maximum drawdown was under 15%, significantly better than the S&P 500's 55% drawdown during the same period. It provided uncorrelated returns, performing well even in recessions (e.g., +23.7% in 2008 and +2.2% in 2022).

5. **Practical Application**: The research is available for a moderate fee, including logic explanations, trading results, and code for platforms like MetaTrader and Tradestation.

6. **Conclusion**: The strategy concludes by emphasizing the effectiveness of candlestick patterns and invites viewers to subscribe for more content on trend-following strategies.

This approach combines technical analysis with systematic backtesting to provide a data-driven trading method.

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7asjNMQ0OU&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy discussed in the video is called the "Turn of the Month" strategy. Here's a summary:

1. **Concept**: The strategy leverages the "end-of-the-month effect," where stocks tend to rally near the end of each month due to factors like salary payments, balance adjustments, and increased savings. This effect typically spills over into the first few days of the new month.

2. **Rules**:
   - Buy the S&P 500 on the close of the fifth trading day of the month.
   - Sell on the close of the third trading day of the following month.

3. **Duration**: The strategy involves holding a position for approximately 7 days each month, freeing up time for other activities.

4. **Performance**:
   - It outperforms the traditional Buy and Hold strategy with an annual return of 7.1% compared to 6.9%, using the same exposure period.
   - Drawdowns are lower; while the Buy and Hold strategy has a maximum drawdown of -56%, the Turn of the Month strategy tops out at -27%.

5. **Flexibility**: The trading rules can be adjusted based on individual experience and market conditions to potentially improve returns.

The video emphasizes that this strategy allows traders to earn consistent monthly profits with minimal time investment, making it an attractive option for those seeking efficiency in their trading activities.

<summary>028. Turnaround Tuesday Trading Strategy (Trading Rules &amp; Backtest)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HClGJJgzv4U&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy discussed in the video is called the "Turnaround Tuesday" strategy, which is based on a seasonal effect observed in the stock market. Here's a summary of the strategy:

1. **Concept**: The idea is that if the stock market experiences a down day on Monday, there is a higher probability that the market will reverse its trend and rise significantly on Tuesday. Conversely, if the market rises on Monday, it tends to flatten or decline on Tuesday.

2. **Trading Rules**:
   - If today is Monday and the closing price of the current trading day (Monday) is lower than Friday's close, buy at the close.
   - Exit the trade either when the close exceeds the previous day's high (Tuesday's close compared to Monday's high) or hold for a maximum of five days.

3. **Performance**:
   - When tested on SPY (an ETF tracking the S&P 500), the strategy produced an impressive equity curve with relatively small drawdowns.
   - The maximum drawdown was short-lived, and other drawdowns were in single digits.
   - The annualized return of the strategy is 10.6%, which is lower than the 99.8% return from a long-term buy-and-hold strategy on SPY over a period starting in 1993.

4. **Comparison with Buy-and-Hold**:
   - While the Turnaround Tuesday strategy has lower returns, it involves being invested only about 24% of the time, keeping 76% of the capital in cash.
   - This cash can be used for other complementary strategies.

5. **Improvements**:
   - The strategy can be tweaked to improve results, which is available to paying subscribers.

6. **Considerations**:
   - It's important to do thorough research and ensure that this or any strategy aligns with your financial goals.
   - The strategy is not presented as investment advice, and viewers are encouraged to perform their own due diligence.

The video concludes by inviting viewers to subscribe for more content and suggests checking out other strategies on the channel's website.

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF7-Ne2BV5k&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy discussed focuses on identifying and capitalizing on "reversal days" in the market. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Bullish Reversal Day Strategy**:
   - **Conditions**: 
     - Today's low is lower than yesterday's low.
     - Today's close is higher than yesterday's close.
     - The 5-day RSI (Relative Strength Index) must be below 35, indicating oversold conditions.
   - **Execution**:
     - Enter the trade on the reversal day (green arrows).
     - Exit after holding for up to 24 days based on backtesting results in Gold (GLD), which showed optimal performance with an average gain of 2.02% when exited after 24 days.
   - **Performance**:
     - The strategy demonstrated a positive profit factor across multiple exit points, suggesting reliability.

2. **Bearish Reversal Day Strategy**:
   - **Conditions**:
     - Today's high is higher than yesterday's high.
     - Today's close is lower than yesterday's close.
     - The 5-day RSI must be above 65, indicating overbought conditions.
   - **Execution**:
     - Enter the trade on the reversal day (green arrows).
     - Exit after holding for up to 24 days.
   - **Performance**:
     - While profitable, returns were significantly lower than the bullish strategy. This underperformance was partly attributed to Gold's long-term upward bias, making it challenging to profit from short positions.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The bullish reversal day strategy performed better in backtesting.
   - The bearish strategy faced difficulties due to the asset's (Gold) inherent upward trend.
   - Both strategies are part of a broader offering for subscribers, including courses and resources available on the provider's website.

The video emphasizes the importance of rigorous backtesting and understanding market dynamics before implementing such strategies.

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXVwz2KE6O8&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy discussed is a volatility-based approach that has been in use for nearly a decade. It performs well across various ETFs and Futures contracts, with the best historical performance on the NASDAQ 100. Key features include:

- **Performance**: The strategy delivers consistent returns, averaging around 13% annually, with minimal drawdowns and no significant losses except during the 2008 financial crisis (max drawdown of 18%). It also performs well in both bull and bear markets.

- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Despite being invested only about 11% of the time and holding trades for less than five days on average, the strategy offers a high risk-adjusted return of nearly 120%.

- **Diversification**: While it works across multiple indexes, it excels on NASDAQ 100. It also shows positive results on S&P 500 and Consumer Staples ETF (XLP), though returns may vary.

- **Rules**: The strategy employs three rules for entry: volatility, price action, and trend filtering, with one rule for exit. It is designed to minimize slippage and commissions due to the low number of trades per year.

The strategy is available for a moderate fee, reflecting its perceived value given its performance and the effort required to maintain it.

<summary>031. Magical RSI Trading Strategy (Backtest &amp; Rules)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsLv-m1AAK4&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy in question employs the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to capitalize on mean reversion in the stock market. Here's a concise summary:

### Strategy Overview:
1. **Objective**: To exploit short-term price corrections (mean reversion) by buying low and selling high.

2. **Entry Signal**:
   - **Condition**: Enter when RSI falls below 20, indicating an oversold condition.
   - **Rationale**: Prices are likely to rebound from undervalued levels.

3. **Exit Signals**:
   - **Conditions**: Exit when either of the following is met:
     - RSI rises above 60 (overbought condition).
     - The current close exceeds the previous day's high.
   - **Rationale**: Prices may have reached a peak or are set to trend upward, prompting an exit.

4. **Instrument**: Primarily applied to ETFs like SPY (S&P 500), XLP (Consumer Staples), and XLV (Healthcare), with potential for other assets.

### Performance Metrics:
- **Backtest Results (1993–2023)**:
  - **Number of Trades**: 351 trades.
  - **Average Gain per Trade**: ~0.8%.
  - **Annual Return**: ~9.2%, slightly less than buy-and-hold (~9.7%).
  - **Win Rate**: 78% of trades profitable.
  - **Time Invested**: 16% annually, indicating a short holding period.
  - **Risk-Adjusted Return**: 56%, calculated by annual return divided by time invested.
  - **Maximum Drawdown**: 23%.

### Key Considerations:
- **Entry/Exit Levels**: The strategy uses RSI levels of 20 and 60, which are tighter than the commonly cited 30 and 70. This may reduce false signals but could also limit participation in strong trends.
- **Execution**: Exits can occur early if prices trend upward quickly, potentially missing prolonged price movements.
- **Drawdown Risk**: The strategy's maximum drawdown of 23% highlights the importance of risk management.

### Conclusion:
This strategy is effective for short-term traders aiming to capture mean reversion in the market. It balances performance with reduced exposure time, offering a competitive risk-adjusted return. However, it requires careful consideration of entry/exit levels and potential limitations during prolonged trends or slow price corrections.

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHbAliaJo-c&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The NR7 trading strategy, developed by Tony Crabbill in 1990, is a volatility-based approach aimed at entering the market during low volatility periods and exiting when volatility increases. Here's a concise summary:

### Key Features:
- **Entry Signal**: Enter long positions at the close of the day when the daily range (High - Low) is the lowest among the previous six trading days.
- **Exit Signal**: Exit the trade at the close if the current day's closing price exceeds the previous day's high.
- **Backtesting Results**: 
  - Tested on SPY ETF from 1993 to present.
  - Starting with $1,000,000, the strategy resulted in:
    - Average gain per trade: ~26%
    - Max drawdown: ~25%
    - Annual return: ~7.6%
- **Comparison**: The annual return is slightly below buy-and-hold (9.7%) but offers better risk-adjusted returns (~20%).
- **Improvement**: Adding a 200-day moving average trend filter reduces max drawdown to ~15% without affecting the average gain.

### Conclusion:
NR7 is an effective strategy for traders seeking to capitalize on low volatility periods with improved risk management.

<summary>033. Why You Should Love A Bear Market! (Trading Strategy)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbT5H87uxio&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy highlighted in the video, referred to as "Bare Market Trading," focuses on exploiting opportunities during bear markets using a combination of technical indicators. Here's a structured summary:

1. **Market Definition**:
   - A bull market occurs when stocks trade above their 200-day moving average.
   - A bear market is identified when stocks are below this same moving average.

2. **Strategy Overview**:
   - The strategy employs mean reversion, anticipating that prices will return to an average after deviation.
   - Utilizes the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on a 2-day period; entering long positions when RSI drops below 10, indicating oversold conditions.
   - Exits trades when the closing price exceeds the previous day's high, signaling strength.

3. **Application Context**:
   - Trades are executed exclusively during bear markets, filtered by QQQ (NASDAQ 100 ETF) being below its 200-day moving average.

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Since 2000, the strategy has yielded an average gain of 1.3% per trade during bear markets, outperforming bull market strategies.
   - Successful during significant bear events like the .com crash, financial crisis, and 2022 downturn.

5. **Rationale Behind Success**:
   - Higher volatility in bear markets leads to inefficiencies, providing opportunities for profit.
   - Despite initial declines due to market problems, solutions often drive price recovery, benefiting long positions.

6. **Short Selling Note**:
   - Short selling strategies are more effective during bear markets due to increased volatility but are exclusive to paid members.

In essence, the strategy capitalizes on mean reversion and market inefficiencies in bear conditions, offering a counterintuitive yet profitable approach compared to bull market tactics.

<summary>035. Averaging Down Trading Strategy (Backtest+Performance)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBOGY39woyA&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

Here’s a concise summary of the trading strategy described:

**Averaging Down Trading Strategy:**

1. **Objective:**  
   Profit from falling stock prices by increasing your position size as the price decreases.

2. **Mechanism:**  
   - Buy additional shares at lower prices to reduce the average cost per share.
   - Example: 
     - Buy 100 shares at $10 each.
     - Price drops to $8; buy another 100 shares.
     - Average cost per share becomes $9.

3. **Conditions:**  
   - Use a rationale (e.g., technical indicators like RSI) to decide when to average down.
   - In the example strategy:
     - Enter when 5-day RSI drops below 50.
     - Add to position if daily RSI falls at least 5 points and remains below 50.

4. **Risk Management:**  
   - Allocate 50% of capital initially, with the option to add the remaining 50% under specific conditions.
   - Reduces maximum loss exposure compared to a standard strategy.

5. **Performance Metrics:**  
   - Slightly lower overall profits but improved risk-adjusted returns (Profit Factor: 55% vs. 39%).

6. **Considerations:**  
   - Averaging down can be controversial due to increased exposure, but it may enhance risk-adjusted performance.
   - Strategy customization and backtesting are essential.

**Conclusion:**  
Averaging down can be a viable strategy if executed with discipline and a clear rationale, potentially improving risk-adjusted returns. Always consider your risk tolerance and thoroughly test strategies before implementation.

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqE3eM2eJio&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy discussed is the carry trade, commonly used in Forex. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Mechanism**: Borrow a currency with a low interest rate and convert it into another currency with a higher interest rate. The goal is to profit from the interest rate differential.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Leverage**: Utilized to amplify returns, but it also increases risk.
   - **Currency Pairs**: Typically involves pairs like the Japanese Yen and Dollar, where one has a low interest rate and the other a higher rate.

3. **Risks**:
   - **High Volatility**: Currencies can experience significant fluctuations, leading to potential large losses.
   - **Negative Skewness**: The strategy is prone to tail risks, as highlighted by Nassim Taleb, meaning it's vulnerable to random shocks that can cause substantial losses.

4. **Outcome**: While the strategy may yield many small wins, it carries a high risk of rare, catastrophic losses due to leverage and market volatility.

In summary, the carry trade leverages interest rate differentials but exposes traders to significant risks from currency movements and leverage.

<summary>041. Supertrend Indicator Strategy (Backtest)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvPsrjGW2tI&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The Super Trend indicator is a trend-following tool designed to capture significant market trends while minimizing drawdowns. Here's a concise summary of the strategy based on the backtesting results:

1. **Indicator Overview**: 
   - The Super Trend indicator uses a median price with added and subtracted average true range (ATR) bands. It generates signals when the price crosses above or below these bands, indicating potential trend changes.
   - The indicator simplifies to a single signal line that switches between upper and lower bands based on market conditions.

2. **Trading Strategy**:
   - **Entry Signal**: Buy when the price closes above the Super Trend indicator.
   - **Exit Signal**: Sell when the price closes below the Super Trend indicator.
   - **Parameters**: Typically uses weekly bars with a 10-bar lookback period and an ATR multiplier of three, though these can be adjusted.

3. **Backtesting Results**:
   - Tested on S&P 500 from 1960 to present.
   - Starting capital of $100,000 grew to approximately $4 million, producing a 44% gain in one example trade.
   - Annualized return of nearly 6% (excluding dividends).
   - Max drawdown of 24%, compared to 56% for buy-and-hold, resulting in a risk-adjusted return of ~9.4%, higher than buy-and-hold's ~7%.

4. **Key Considerations**:
   - Requires a long-term mindset as it doesn't trade frequently (only 38 trades since 1960).
   - The indicator is not very active, keeping you invested only about 63% of the time.

This strategy aims to balance risk and reward effectively, making it suitable for patient, long-term investors.

   - **Strategy 2**: Using VIX and Bollinger Bands. This strategy involves buying the S&P 500 if the VIX breaks above its 10-day upper band, with an exit rule based on recent price action. It yields a steady equity curve but underperforms buy-and-hold returns.
   - **Strategy 3**: A breakout strategy combining VIX highs and RSI (Relative Strength Index). This strategy shows slightly better performance than the previous one.
   - **Strategy 4**: An overnight strategy where positions are held for 24 hours. This approach is designed to capitalize on short-term market moves but still underperforms buy-and-hold returns.

3. **Key Takeaways**:
   - The VIX can be a useful tool for identifying potential trading opportunities, particularly during periods of fear or uncertainty.
   - While the strategies tested do not outperform buy-and-hold in absolute terms, they offer lower drawdowns and risk-adjusted returns, making them attractive options depending on risk tolerance.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The video emphasizes the importance of using the VIX to identify trading opportunities, especially during periods of market stress. It concludes with a quote highlighting that buying when there's fear in the market can be profitable, aligning with the idea of contrarian investing.

<summary>046. IBS - Internal Bar Strength Trading STRATEGY (Statistic &amp; Backtest)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URPUON-P3zY&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy introduced in the video revolves around the Internal Bar Strength (IBS) indicator, which is calculated as (Today's Close - Low) / (Today's High - Low). This indicator fluctuates between 0 and 1, with low values indicating a weak close near the daily low and high values indicating a strong close near the daily high. The strategy aims to capitalize on short-term market pullbacks using mean reversion principles.

Three specific strategies are outlined:

1. **First Strategy**: Buy when IBS is below 0.1 and sell when it exceeds 0.9. Backtesting on QQQ (Nasdaq-100 ETF) showed a significant return, with an annualized growth rate of over 12% from 2000 to 2023, despite being invested only 38% of the time.

2. **Second Strategy**: Uses a two-day average of the IBS indicator. Buy when the average is below 0.25 and sell when it exceeds 0.75. Backtesting on XLP (Consumer Staples ETF) resulted in steady growth, with an annualized return of 6.3% from 2000 onwards, invested only 33% of the time.

3. **Third Strategy**: Combines the IBS indicator with a three-day RSI. Buy when RSI is below 30 and IBS is below 0.2; sell when either the price exceeds yesterday's high or IBS exceeds 0.9. Backtesting on SPY (S&P 500 ETF) demonstrated robust performance, yielding an annualized return of 9.6% since 1993, with only 18% investment time and a Max drawdown of 23%.

Overall, the IBS indicator is highlighted as a powerful tool for short-term trading, offering significant returns with relatively low risk when used appropriately. The strategies emphasize simplicity and effectiveness, making them accessible to traders looking for systematic approaches in volatile markets.

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UURZzdzdxTQ&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The video presents three index trading strategies, each with specific rules and settings. Here's a summary of each:

1. **Commodities to Equity Ratio Strategy**:
   - Compares the performance of commodities (using the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index) against equities (S&P 500).
   - Uses a short moving average (21 days) to generate trading signals.
   - Produces an annual return of nearly 9%, outperforming the S&P 500, though it is volatile.

2. **Value and Growth Rotation Strategy**:
   - Trades between value (IUSV ETF) and growth (IUSG ETF) indices based on a moving average crossover system.
   - Achieves an annual return of almost 9%, with less volatility compared to individual indexes.

3. **Mean Reversion Strategy**:
   - Focuses on the S&P 500 (SPY ETF) with a simple buy and sell rule.
   - Generates significant returns (15.5% annually) by being invested only 35% of the time, with a modest maximum drawdown.

The video emphasizes diversification across strategies, markets, and asset classes, and advises viewers to use demo accounts before trading live. It also highlights that index trading is generally less volatile than Forex or commodities and can be combined with individual stock trading for broader exposure.

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkoTdKV65yk&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

Here's a concise summary of the trading strategy presented:

1. **Overview**: The video introduces three mean reversion trading strategies, tested on different ETFs, aimed at enhancing trading performance.

2. **Mean Reversion Defined**: This strategy assumes that asset prices revert to their average after significant deviations. It involves buying oversold assets and selling overbought ones.

3. **Strategies Discussed**:
   - **First Strategy (XLP ETF)**: Focuses on the consumer staples sector, trading daily with rules based on price drops and strength. Performance matches buy-and-hold returns with lower risk.
   - **Second Strategy (FXI ETF)**: Targets Chinese markets, using an IBS indicator for mean reversion. It outperforms buy-and-hold but is challenging due to the market's upward bias.
   - **Third Strategy (SPY ETF)**: Traders S&P 500 with a simple rule—buy on a five-day low and sell at a higher close or after five days. Returns are similar to buy-and-hold despite lower involvement.

4. **Performance**: All strategies show strong risk-adjusted returns, with the first two outperforming buy-and-hold and the third closely matching it.

5. **Optimal Conditions**: Mean reversion works best during bear markets due to higher volatility. Long positions generally perform better than short ones.

6. **Conclusion**: While not superior to trend-following strategies, mean reversion is a viable approach, especially for those seeking lower risk and consistent returns.

The video concludes by encouraging viewers to join for strategy codes and hints at upcoming trend-following content.

<summary>049. What Happens When Stock Markets Are Overbought?</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8lL3DBl44E&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy discussed focuses on identifying overbought conditions in the stock market using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) as a key indicator. Here's a concise summary of the strategy:

1. **Understanding Overbought and Mean Reversion**: The strategy is based on the principle of mean reversion, where strong deviations from the trend are expected to revert to the average. Overbought conditions occur when the market experiences significant growth over a defined period (e.g., days, weeks, or months).

2. **Using RSI Indicator**: The RSI is used to identify overbought conditions. A two-day RSI above 95 signals that the market is overbought.

3. **Trading Rules**:
   - Buy (entry) the S&P 500 at the close when the two-day RSI is above 95.
   - Sell (exit) at the close after a specified number of days, depending on the strategy's parameters.

4. **Backtesting Results**: Backtests show that returns in the short term (first five days) are lower than the long-term average (~0.05% per day). However, as time progresses, returns tend to align with long-term averages, suggesting mean reversion.

5. **Conclusion**: The strategy highlights that overbought conditions may lead to lower short-term returns but can offer opportunities for longer-term investors due to the expected reversion to the mean.

This approach aims to help traders make informed decisions by leveraging statistical analysis and technical indicators like RSI.

<summary>050. Martingale Trading Strategy (Backtest &amp; Rules)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlvO82W6QlA&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The Martingale trading strategy is a high-risk approach often used in gambling, not typically recommended for financial markets due to its significant drawbacks. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Strategy Overview**: 
   - The strategy involves doubling the bet size after each loss, aiming to recover all previous losses with a single win.
   - It assumes a 50% chance of winning each trade and relies on eventually recovering losses through one successful trade.

2. **How It Works**:
   - Start with an initial bet (e.g., $100).
   - After each loss, double the bet size: $200, then $400, etc.
   - Theoretically, a win should cover all previous losses and yield a small profit.

3. **Risks in Financial Markets**:
   - **Probability Issue**: In real markets, the probability of winning isn't 50%. Extended losing streaks can quickly deplete capital.
   - **Recoupment Problem**: Even if a winning trade occurs, it must offset all previous losses, which requires a larger win than the sum of prior losses.

4. **Practical Example**:
   - Tested on the S&P 500 with specific rules (e.g., using RSI indicators), the strategy showed an annual return of 8.7% but was underutilized.
   - Modifying to use only partial equity worsened performance, reducing gains and increasing potential losses.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The Martingale strategy is risky and unsuitable for most traders due to its high dependency on luck and the probability of significant account losses.
   - It's more fitting for gambling scenarios rather than serious trading.

In summary, while the Martingale strategy can theoretically recover losses, it poses substantial risks in financial markets, making it a poor choice for traders seeking sustainable returns.

<summary>051. 3 Simple LITECOIN Crypto Trading Strategies | Crypto</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3J7x3AUEaw&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategies discussed focus on Litecoin, a cryptocurrency known for its rapid transaction times. Three distinct approaches are outlined:

1. **Short-Term Trend Following Strategy**: This strategy uses the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) to generate buy and sell signals. If the closing price surpasses the SMA, a long position is taken; if it falls below, a short position is initiated. It has demonstrated superior performance compared to a Buy-and-Hold approach, with an average gain of 8.4% per trade and an annual return of 114%.

2. **Long-Term Trend Following Strategy**: Utilizing 100-day and 250-day SMAs, this strategy signals a long entry when the shorter SMA crosses above the longer one and prompts a sell when the reverse occurs. Despite a smaller sample size (7 trades), it delivered an annual return of 66%, outperforming Buy-and-Hold.

3. **Momentum Strategy**: This approach checks if today's closing price is higher or lower than the price from 25 days prior to decide whether to go long or short. With 129 trades, it achieved an average gain of 9.6% per trade and a 70% annual return, again outpacing Buy-and-Hold.

Each strategy leverages different aspects of market behavior—short-term trends, long-term trends, and momentum—to capitalize on Litecoin's volatility. The video emphasizes the importance of testing and adapting strategies to fit individual trading styles and market conditions.

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJp8E3HmqG8&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy outlined is a systematic approach based on monthly trading signals for the S&P 500. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Entry Point**: The strategy enters a long position at the close of the fifth trading day from the end of each month.

2. **Exit Point**: It exits the position at the close of the third trading day of the following month.

3. **Investment Frequency**: The strategy is invested approximately 33% of the time, holding positions for roughly a third of each month.

4. **Performance**: Despite being less invested, it has matched or exceeded the returns of a Buy and Hold strategy since 1960, yielding around seven percent annually.

5. **Risk Management**: The maximum drawdown is notably smaller, being half that of the Buy and Hold approach, thus reducing volatility risk.

6. **Equity Growth**: The equity curve shows consistent growth over time, indicating steady returns without major fluctuations beyond expected market behavior.

This strategy aims to capture market gains while mitigating downside risks through controlled entry and exit points.

<summary>053. 3 Bollinger Band Trading Strategies (+Backtest)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZErni3FA24w&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy summarized focuses on using Bollinger Bands, a popular technical indicator, to identify trends, measure volatility, and find potential breakouts or mean reversion opportunities. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **Understanding Bollinger Bands**:
   - Composed of three components: a middle band (simple moving average), an upper band, and a lower band.
   - The upper and lower bands are typically two standard deviations away from the middle band.
   - They help measure market volatility; widening bands indicate high volatility, while tightening bands suggest low volatility.

2. **Common Trading Techniques**:
   - **Mean Reversion Strategy**: Enter long when the price closes below the lower band (two standard deviations) and exit when it crosses above the middle band. Backtesting on SPX showed mixed results but was untradable due to significant drawdowns.
   - **Bollinger Band Squeeze**: When bands tighten, indicating low volatility, it may signal an explosive move. However, backtests found limited usefulness across assets.
   - **Trend Trading**: Use Bollinger Bands to identify potential breakouts or reversals by observing how prices interact with the bands.

3. **Mean Reversion Strategy (Optimized)**:
   - Use a 5-day moving average and reduce bands to 1.5 standard deviations.
   - Buy when SPX closes below the lower band and sell on strength when closing above the previous day's high.
   - This strategy achieved an annual return of 9% since 1993, with a win rate of 76%, invested only 25% of the time.

4. **Advantages and Disadvantages**:
   - **Pros**: Easy to understand, provides volatility insights, can indicate trend directions.
   - **Cons**: Rules based on bands may lead to large drawdowns; asset-specific behavior requires tailored approaches.

5. **Common Mistakes**:
   - Blindly following signals without considering the broader market trend or context.
   - Overlooking the need for backtesting and adapting strategies to different assets.

6. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Different types of Bollinger Bands (e.g., percentage, bandwidth) exist but weren't detailed here.
   - Combining with other indicators can enhance effectiveness, but thorough backtesting is essential.

In conclusion, while Bollinger Bands offer valuable insights, their success depends on careful strategy design, backtesting, and adaptation to different market conditions and assets.

The video discusses three dual momentum trading strategies, each with different asset pairs and trading rules. Here's a summary:

1. **Stocks vs Bonds (SPY & TLT):**
   - **Trading Rules:** At the end of every month, invest in the ETF (SPY or TLT) that has performed better over the last three months.
   - **Performance:** The strategy has delivered an annualized return of 11.5%, with a maximum drawdown of 30%. It underperformed post-2020 but generally outperforms during market stability.

2. **Stocks vs Gold (SPY & GLD):**
   - **Trading Rules:** Similar to the first strategy, investing in the better-performing asset over three months.
   - **Performance:** This strategy shows promise, especially during market volatility, with a potential for higher returns but also increased risk during drawdown periods.

3. **Stocks vs Cash (SPY & CASH):**
   - **Trading Rules:** Allocate to SPY if it outperforms cash; otherwise, hold cash.
   - **Performance:** This strategy aims to balance growth and safety. Returns are modest compared to others but offers a conservative approach with lower drawdowns.

**Key Points:**
- Dual momentum strategies rely on relative performance between asset pairs.
- They are easy to implement but not guaranteed to yield profits.
- Market timing is avoided, reducing stress and potential mistakes.
- Drawdowns can be significant, especially during market crashes.

The video emphasizes the importance of thorough research and adapting strategies to personal investment goals. It also highlights that while these strategies are simple, they are not without risks and require careful consideration.

The trading strategy discussed during Ramadan involves analyzing the stock market performance during this holy month. Here's a summary:

1. **Ramadan Overview**: Ramadan is a significant Muslim holiday that varies each year in the Gregorian calendar. The strategy focuses on countries where Ramadan is widely celebrated, such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt.

   - Sell after the holiday ends.
   - The rationale is to capitalize on potential market movements during this period.

3. **Performance**:
   - In the U.S., the strategy yielded an annual return of approximately 1.1%, slightly better than a "Buy and Hold" approach but not significantly superior.
   - When tested on ETFs from Saudi Arabia (KSA), Egypt (EGPT), and Turkey (2R), the performance was flat over 15 years.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The strategy shows modest returns in the U.S. but lacks strong performance in Muslim countries.
   - It is presented as one of many strategies available on their website, encouraging viewers to explore further.

This strategy may not be highly effective but offers an alternative approach for traders interested in market behavior during specific holidays.

<summary>059. 3 Top Bitcoin Trading Strategies (Backtest Results)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSHNnwcMIO8&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The video presents three Bitcoin trading strategies, each based on different principles:

1. **MACD Histogram Strategy**: This strategy uses the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) histogram to generate buy and sell signals. The histogram is calculated as the difference between the MACD line and the signal line. When the histogram turns positive, a buy signal is generated, and when it turns negative, a sell signal is triggered. Backtesting shows that this strategy outperforms a buy-and-hold approach, with an annual return of 77% versus 61%, while being invested only 54% of the time.

2. **25-Day Breakout Strategy**: This momentum-based strategy involves buying Bitcoin when its price breaks above the close from 25 days prior and selling when it breaks below that level. The strategy has a low win rate (around 43%) but still generates solid returns, with an average annual return higher than holding Bitcoin. It keeps traders invested only 56% of the time.

3. **Seasonal Pattern Strategy**: This strategy is based on buying Bitcoin on the fifth-to-last trading day of the month and selling it on the third trading day of the following month. Backtesting indicates strong performance, with an average annual return of nearly 41%, while being invested only 23% of the time. However, recent performance has been flattening.

<summary>060. 200-Day MA Strategy (Backtest, Rules And Performance)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEZ6Wy_EYmU&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy summarized revolves around using the 200-day Moving Average (MA) as a key indicator, inspired by Paul Tudor Jones. Here's a concise breakdown:

1. **Trend Following Strategy**:
   - **Entry Signal**: Invest when the S&P 500 is above its 200-day MA.
   - **Exit Signal**: Sell when the index falls below this average.
   - Performance: Since 1960, excluding dividends, this strategy has yielded a 6.75% annualized return versus buy-and-hold's 7%. It notably reduces drawdowns (28% max vs. 56% for buy-and-hold) by avoiding severe market crashes, such as the 2008 financial crisis.

2. **Filtering Short-Term Trades**:
   - **Mean Reversion Strategy**: Traders can use a standard mean reversion approach, e.g., buying when RSI is below 35 and selling above 50.
   - However, this strategy has a high max drawdown (29%), making it challenging for traders to adhere to.

3. **Combining with 200-day MA**:
   - Adding the 200-day MA as a filter improves returns by reducing volatility and increasing the win rate. Trades are taken only when above the MA, leading to fewer trades but higher average gains per trade and better win rates.

4. **Performance Comparison**:
   - Traders below the MA experience more erratic performance due to higher volatility, which is less favorable for sustained trading success.

5. **Conclusion**:
   The strategy leverages simplicity and trend-following to enhance risk-adjusted returns. While it may not outperform buy-and-hold in raw returns, its lower drawdowns offer a safer approach with compounding benefits. The 200-day MA serves as both a trend indicator and a filter for mean reversion strategies, making it a versatile tool for traders.

This strategy emphasizes the importance of aligning with market trends while mitigating volatility, highlighting the value of simplicity in trading systems.

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=few_gh6Td8E&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy discussed focuses on identifying oversold conditions in the stock market using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Oversold Condition**: The strategy defines an oversold market as one that has experienced a period of falling prices, typically for five days on a daily trading frame.

2. **RSI Indicator**: The RSI is used to measure the velocity of price movements. When RSI values are below 20, it indicates an oversold condition, suggesting undervalued securities and potential upward movement.

3. **Trading Rules**:
   - **Entry**: Buy SPX (S&P 500) at the close when the three-day RSI is below 20.
   - **Exit**: Sell at the close after N days or when the next day's price is higher than yesterday's high, whichever comes first.

4. **Back Testing Results**:
   - The strategy shows steady equity growth from $100,000 to $1.3 million over the tested period.
   - Annualized returns of 9.14% with low drawdowns.
   - Risk-adjusted return calculated as 54 (annual return divided by time in the market).

5. **Conclusion**: The strategy suggests that higher short-term returns can be expected during oversold conditions, making it a potentially effective approach for traders looking to capitalize on mean reversion.

This summary highlights a systematic approach to trading based on oversold conditions and RSI, aiming to maximize risk-adjusted returns through selective market participation.

4. **Three-Day High/Low Strategy**:
   - Enter when above the 200-DMA and both high and low have trended lower for three consecutive days.
   - Exit at the next close after entry or if the close is below the previous day's close.
   - Results in a 3.6% annual return with minimal market exposure.

5. **Key Takeaways**:
   - Mean reversion strategies (buying dips) have been effective since 1985.
   - The 200-DMA effectively filters out Bull and Bear markets, limiting drawdowns to around 14% for all strategies.
   - Strategies often remain on the sidelines, allowing potential for complementary trading.
   - Avoid combining all six strategies into a portfolio due to similarity, which can reduce effectiveness.

The trading strategy in question revolves around leveraging market volatility and utilizing a 200-day moving average as a market regime filter. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Market Regime Filter**: The 200-day moving average is used to determine whether the market is in a bullish (above the average) or bearish (below the average) phase.

The signals are designed to account for market conditions, making it unnecessary to adjust for bull or bear markets explicitly.

In essence, the strategy emphasizes following predefined trading signals without overcomplicating decisions about market direction, as the system adapts to varying volatility levels and market regimes.

After optimizing on SPY, the optimal parameters were identified: a 5-day lookback period with a buy threshold at 5% and a sell threshold at 80%. However, this initial approach resulted in significant drawdowns. To improve performance, two modifications were made:

1. **Sell Condition**: Instead of solely relying on the indicator hitting 80%, trades are now closed when:
   - The close crosses above yesterday's high (indicating strength).
   - The close falls below yesterday's low (indicating weakness).

2. **Trend Line Check**: An additional condition was added where trades are either held or closed based on whether the price breaks above or below a trend line.

The equity curve shows that these modifications reduced drawdowns and improved overall profitability, resulting in a more robust strategy. The final approach is to buy when the indicator hits 5% and sell under the specified conditions related to price strength and trend line breaks.

The trading strategy discussed is called the "Failed Bounce" strategy. Here's a summary of its key points:

1. **Entry Rules**:
   - Yesterday's IBS (Internal Bar Strength) must be at least 0.6 or higher.
   - Yesterday's low should be lower than the lowest low from the previous five days.

2. **Exit Rule**:
   - Exit when today's close is higher than yesterday's high.

3. **Performance**:
   - The strategy has been tested on stocks since the late 1980s.
   - Out of 204 trades, 77% were winners with an average return of 0.86% per trade.
   - Net profit was 450%, resulting in a 5.8% annualized return.

4. **Risk-Adjusted Return**:
   - The strategy is invested only 8.5% of the time, yielding a risk-adjusted return of 67%.

5. **Applicability**:
   - Works on ETFs based on stocks but not Commodities or bonds.
   - Performed well on QQQ with a 1% average per trade.

6. **Additional Info**:

<summary>071. Golden Cross Trading Strategy (Guide+Backtest)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okJHlykwQYo&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy discussed is based on the Golden Cross indicator, which involves using the 50-day moving average crossing above the 200-day moving average to signal a bullish breakout (buy signal) and crossing below it to signal a bearish breakout (sell signal). The strategy aims to minimize losses during bear markets and maximize gains in bull markets. 

Key points from the summary:
1. **Golden Cross Indicator**: 
   - A short-term moving average (50-day) crossing above a long-term moving average (200-day) indicates a bullish trend, prompting a buy.
   - Conversely, if the 50-day crosses below the 200-day, it signals a bearish trend, prompting a sell.

2. **Performance**:
   - Backtested on the S&P 500 from 1960 onwards, resulting in 32 trades held for approximately 350 days each.
   - 78% of trades were winners with an average gain of 15.4% and an annual return of 6.6%.
   - The strategy was only active 69% of the time compared to buy-and-hold, which is active 100% of the time.

3. **Risk-Adjusted Return**:
   - Lower drawdowns (33%) compared to buy-and-hold (56%), leading to a better risk-adjusted return of 9.5%.
   - The strategy aims to reduce losses during bear markets while capitalizing on bull market gains.

4. **Additional Strategy**:
   - Mentioned the short-term NR7 strategy as another system that complements this approach.

<summary>072. Doji Reversal Trading Strategy (Backtest + Candlesticks Rules)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3St7_mOOOI&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy discussed in the video revolves around utilizing doji candlestick patterns to identify potential reversals in the market. Here's a structured summary and analysis:

1. **Doji Candlesticks**: These are characterized by small bodies and long upper and lower shadows, indicating indecision between buyers and sellers. There are four types: neutral, gravestone, dragonfly, and long-legged doji.

2. **Trading Strategy**:
   - **Entry Signal**: Buy when one of the four doji patterns appears.
   - **Initial Exit Rule**: Sell after five trading days, resulting in an average gain of 0.28% per trade, slightly better than random periods.
   - **Improved Exit Rules**:
     - Sell if the close is higher than yesterday's high, exploiting mean reversion.
     - Incorporate a 5-day RSI filter (below 50) to buy only when the market is oversold.

3. **Performance**:
   - The initial strategy showed an average gain of 0.28% with holding periods up to five days.
   - Adding an exit rule based on closing prices higher than yesterday's high improved performance but didn't linearize the equity curve, indicating potential volatility.
   - Implementing the RSI filter reduced trade frequency but increased average gains to 0.54%, though it didn't notably improve the equity curve.

4. **Considerations and Concerns**:
   - **Back-Testing Limitations**: Risk of overfitting to historical data, potentially reducing real-world reliability.
   - **Transaction Costs**: Frequent trades could incur significant fees and slippage.
   - **Volatility and Drawdowns**: The strategy may involve substantial market fluctuations and drawdowns, affecting risk tolerance.
   - **Market Conditions**: Effectiveness might vary across different market environments (e.g., trending vs. ranging markets).
   - **Opportunity Cost**: Holding cash 65% of the time could mean missing out on larger gains in strong uptrends.

5. **Conclusion**:
   While the strategy shows promise with systematic rules and better-than-random results, it's important to consider real-world factors like transaction costs, volatility, and varying market conditions. Further research into historical performance and testing across different assets and timeframes could provide deeper insights. Combining this strategy with other indicators might enhance reliability but adds complexity.

In summary, the doji-based strategy offers a structured approach to trading, but traders should be mindful of its limitations and potential risks in real-world applications.

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL9gnzI5Akc&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy in question is designed for closed-end funds (CEFs) and focuses on reducing market exposure to minimize drawdowns while aiming for significant returns. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Strategy Overview**: 
   - The strategy uses the daily price-to-NAV ratio of CEFs and applies a 2-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) to determine entry and exit points.
   
2. **Entry and Exit Rules**:
   - Enter a long position when the 2-day RSI of the price-to-NAV ratio crosses below 10, indicating potential undervaluation.
   - Exit the trade when the 2-day RSI crosses above 60, suggesting overvaluation.

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Backtesting with fund ticker EtG resulted in 212 trades, an average gain of 48%, and a time spent in the market at 133% (indicating limited holding periods).
   - Maximum drawdown was 26%, significantly lower than buy-and-hold's 74%.

4. **Objective**:
   - To reduce market exposure by holding positions only when signaled, aiming for higher returns with lower risk compared to a passive approach.

5. **Considerations**:
   - RSI signals may fail in trending markets; strategy specificity to CEFs suggests possible limitations outside this asset class.
   - Backtest results do not guarantee future performance.

In essence, the strategy seeks to capitalize on short-term price discrepancies relative to NAV using momentum indicators, aiming for efficient trading with reduced risk.

The trading strategy discussed in the video revolves around using Hikanashi (also spelled Haikinashi) candles as a trend-following indicator. Here's a concise summary:

1. **What is Hikanashi?**  
   - It’s a charting technique originating from Japan, introduced to the West in the late 1980s.
   - Unlike traditional Japanese candlesticks, Hikanashi uses smoothed average prices (open, high, low, close) to highlight trends and consolidation phases.
   - The open price of each Hikanashi candle is the midpoint of the previous candle's body, eliminating gaps.

2. **Key Features**:
   - It’s a lagging indicator and not based on real-time prices.
   - Useful for smoothing out price noise and identifying directional trends.
   - Best suited for long time frames (e.g., monthly bars).

3. **Trading Strategy**:
   - **Entry Signal**: Buy when the close of the Hikanashi candle crosses above its open.
   - **Exit Signal**: Sell when the close crosses below its open.
   - Tested on the S&P 500 index using monthly data from 1960 to present.

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Annual return: ~4.77% (vs. Buy & Hold at ~7%).
   - Lower maximum drawdown (~30%) compared to Buy & Hold (~53%), making it less risky.

5. **Recommendations**:
   - Backtest any strategy before risking real money.
   - Combine with other indicators for enhanced results.

In conclusion, Hikanashi can be a valuable tool for trend-following strategies, particularly on longer time frames, but it’s essential to backtest and use it alongside other techniques for optimal performance.

<summary>088. Stocks During War And Conflict (Profit from War Stocks)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJaolkzOkWQ&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy discussed in the video suggests that historically, stock markets have not experienced significant declines during times of war, with the maximum loss being around 20% after events like Pearl Harbor. The reasoning behind this is multifaceted:

1. **Government Spending and Economic Activity**: Wars can stimulate government spending, which may boost economic activity.
2. **Anticipation by Markets**: Conflicts are often anticipated and priced into markets before they begin, reducing surprise and panic.
3. **Volatility Decrease**: Interestingly, market volatility tends to decrease during conflicts, contrary to intuition.

The strategy advises investors to consider the following:

- If your local market is not directly involved in the conflict, it might be prudent to "buy on the sound of cannons" (i.e., invest when conflict begins) and "sell on the sound of trumpets" (i.e., sell as peace negotiations or resolutions begin).

This approach is a general rule, and investors should consider their individual circumstances and consult with financial advisors. For more detailed strategies, the video recommends visiting Quantified Strategies' website or YouTube channel.

<summary>089. Relative Vigor Index (RVI) Strategy (Backtest)</summary>

[[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLFujYKDyGA&list=PLHFlSdhbIZ6TEeEg4cHQ-3888yUnHZs5v)

The trading strategy presented involves using the Relative Vigor Index (RVI) as a momentum indicator. Here's a concise summary of the strategy:

1. **Definition and Calculation**:
   - The RVI measures price momentum by comparing closing prices to their trading range.
   - It includes a signal line, which is a simple moving average used to smooth results.

2. **Strategy Rules**:
   - A 5-day lookback period is used.
   - **Buy Signal**: Execute a buy when the RVI crosses above its signal line and the 5-day RSI of the RVI is below 50.
   - **Sell Signal**: Sell when the RVI crosses below its signal line.

3. **Performance**:
   - Tested on GLD (gold ETF), the strategy yielded an average gain of 0.44% per trade with a win rate of 51%, though winners outweighed losers in size.
   - The strategy was not effective on assets like the S&P 500 or bonds, indicating it may work better in specific market conditions.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - While the RVI is underutilized and showed promise on GLD, its effectiveness can vary across different assets. Further testing and adaptation are recommended for broader applicability.
